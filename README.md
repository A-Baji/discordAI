# DiscordAI

DiscordAI is CLI package that you can use to run your discord bot. It comes with two slash commands that use openAI's API to create prompt completions. There are also two hidden commands that are used to synchronize your bot's commands with discord: `@bot_name sync|unsyc guild|global`.

## Planned Features

- A CLI command that generates a customized openai model based on a given discord user's messages from a given discord channel.
- A CLI command that generates a new slash command for your bot to create prompt completions using a given customized model.
